        <h3>Game Narrative Designer</h3>

        <p>My name is Tristan Bakker, and I'm a narrative designer from Fenton Michigan. I studied at Michigan State University, where I was apart of the Games and Interactive Media major, as well as double minors in Game Design and Development, as well as Creative Fiction Writing.</p>

        <p>I'm interested in pursuing a career in the creation of stories and experiences that will leave players thinking about their interactions for days on end after witnessing them, and building something that many people will connect with.</p>

        <p>In addition to my career, I am also well versed in the collection of Warhammer 40k miniatures, where I currently hold an army of Grey Knights and am in the process of constructing many. I also enjoy outdoor activities, running, and trivia.</p>
