    <p>Bewitched was a semester long project along with a moderately sized team of fourteen members. It was my first experience at a 'triple A' quality of game, where in the stuido-like class our team was represented as the larger team project. I served as the Lead Design, initial systems designer, Technical Writer, and Narrative Designer.</p>

            <p>One of the issues we had for our high-effot game was selling the plot behind our game, and giving more backround information about the game. People were interested in what the different monsters and enemies were doing in the dungeons. We came up with the idea of a compendium, an interactive menu to learn more about the systems of the game and everything you would encounter. To the left is a screenshot of a lot of our compendium pages that were written up in our github project repo, where I spent a lot of my time, making sure everything was properly updated.</p>

            <p>To the right is an example of the final product of our compendium pages. I spent a good amount of time to get all of our photos for each enemy set up and properly explain to the players what each item does. I first wrote everything up in our technical documents in our GitHub repo, as seen in the image above, and then later ported into the game once it was approved. </p>
